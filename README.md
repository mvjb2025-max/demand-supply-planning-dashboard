# Inventory Planning Dashboard (Power BI Demo)

This is a small Power BI demo I built from an anonymised 12-month planning dataset.

The goal was to show how I would:
- Visualise **demand vs supply** and projected **closing stock**,
- Track **net inventory change** (supply – demand) by month,
- Monitor **weeks of cover** against a target range, and
- Turn the view into a simple **exception report** with clear risks and actions.

## Pages

**Page 1 – Demand & Inventory Overview**
- Monthly demand forecast vs supply plan (lead-time adjusted)
- Closing stock line over 12 months
- Net inventory change (supply – demand) by month
- KPI cards for total demand, total supply, net change and minimum weeks of cover

**Page 2 – Exceptions & Actions**
- Table of high-risk months (stock below safety or well above target)
- Weeks of cover vs target band (e.g. 3–8 weeks)
- Written summary of key risks and suggested mitigation actions

_Data is dummy / anonymised and used purely for demonstration purposes._
